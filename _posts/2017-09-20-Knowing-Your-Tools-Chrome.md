Sometimes it is the tool we use everyday that is slowing us down, so I plan to
make a series of blog posts about the tools or IDEs a lot of us are using everyday to help boost our dev efficiency. The first of the series will be about the most popular
browser `Chrome`. Even when we are using it so much everyday for online searches,
checking blog posts, browsing social networks or even debugging codes, it does not
necessarily mean we are using it efficiently. Therefore, I decide
to start this series by tackling this most widely used tool first and hope this can boost
your browsing speed and improve your dev efficiency if you are a frequent dev tool user.

<aside class="notice">
<strong>Note</strong>: All the shortcuts or tools are for Mac users and they are only tested
for common US keyboards and are not guaranteed to work if you have some other shortcuts set-up,
although you should always be able to find ways to override the default shortcut settings.

# Using Chrome as a Web Browser

Nowadays, we rely on the World Wide Web a lot to get us information. Combined with
search engines, a web browser can easily help us retrieve tons of pieces of information. When I
dive into a new programming language or a new technique, the first thing I do if I
got stuck is to open a browser and type in some keyword to get the related posts or
the detailed online documentations. But we can definitely improve our efficiency if we
know a little more about our browser to better sort out
the tangled "web".

## Shortcuts
As many other tools you use everyday, Chrome comes with a lot of default shortcuts.
I don't expect to remember them all, but there do exist some very useful ones that
would help us improve our browsing speed a lot. I categorized a couple of them to help you reference or remember.

## Organizing Your Bookmarks
It is nice to have bookmarks to help you remember the websites you constantly visit.
In practice, however, it is usually used to mark all kinds of webpages that look interesting
but somehow too time-consuming to be finished right now. The result is a messy collection of bookmarks that make it very hard for me to navigate to the true resource that I am looking for.

While there are a bunch of addons that can be useful by deleting duplicate links and so on, I find the default bookmark manager is generally good enough for organizing things in a useful way. You can install the [Bookmark Manager Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-manager/gmlllbghnfkpflemihljekbapjopfjik) if you like to utilize some more advanced features such as suggested folders. The extension looks pretty nice, so feel free to install it.  But when it comes to organizing things, I always believe simpler is better.

How to make it simpler, the first thing is always to remove stuff. This is the same thing as organizing your dorm or house, you can never go anywhere without a regression if you are not willing to get rid of unused things. You might find something that is of your interest but you barely look at it for more than a year, delete it. You probably don't need it. Moreover, you can always use search engine someday if you really need to find it.


Second step is to picture what you want your bookmark to look like after you organize it. For example, as a tech woman, most of my saved links could be related to programming, my research or electronic deals. Then I will make sure they are organized into separate folders. Don't stop at one level though, since you probably will not be following one technique regarding programming, you can consider creating a folder for each sub-category that you are interested in.

I would highly recommend the usage of a multi-level file tree instead of grouping every small subset into a root folder. The main reason is that we have limited space in the bookmark bar, it probably can handle 5 to 10 bookmark folders easily, but more than that is likely to make your content hidden away from a glance.

Besides using folders, you might also want to save some website icons to your bookmark bar simply to save the typing time. Since the space is very limited, you probably would want to delete bookmark names and keep only the favicons.

Of course at least for some time of the day you are just browsing the websites for fun. But usually you don't really need to bookmark those websites since I don't think you will forget them. Bookmarking them does not really save you time since Chrome is smart enough to autocomplete your typing in the address bar if you do visit these websites frequently enough. This habit might even benefit you from wasting too much time on those websites since they are not hanging in your bookmark bar on the time. Make sure all contents in the bookmark are those things that you want to take with you even when you switch computers.

Keeping your bookmark fresh and interesting is not an easy task, but once you reach there, it can truly boost your efficiency in finding useful infos or making context switching (I will talk a little more on this in the next section).

## Organizing Your Tabs
Quotes from [Lauren Moon](https://blog.trello.com/too-many-browser-tabs):
> When you are jumping from tab to tab your brain is releasing dopamine receptors that are giving you the illusion that you are being more productive. You brain, however, is not actually processing all of these stimuli.

In most cases, you do not need to open all these tabs, multitasking in most cases, is worse than focusing on one thing at a time. Like computers, our brain is doing context switching when we are trying to do multitasking, making it harder to complete each task efficiently. Since it is much cheaper (it is even cheaper with all the shortcuts introduced in the first section) to open up a new tab instead of finishing the old one, you might get nothing in your brain after jumping from one tab to another. You probably have also heard the fan of your computer howling and seen the mouse icon spinning as more and more tabs/windows opened are killing your RAM.

To save your applications from crashing due to too many Chrome tabs. Here are some rules for browsing tabs.

**Rule 1**: try not to do multitasking. For each link you open, try to finish extracting the information that prompted you to visit this link in the first place and then close it. If it is truly a very large website or a doc site and you think you might not be able to finish the whole content right now, make it a bookmark using the technique in the previous section.

**Rule 2**: If you have some pages that you always want to keep it open, try to pin it in the window such that you don't try to open multiple of them or accidentally close them. Example pages may include email pages, music pages (yeah I always listen to light music when I am working), etc.

**Rule_3**: If you have to do multitasking due to some urgent scenario that have to interrupt your current browsing activity. Do one of the following:
* If you believe you can go back to your previous activity soon, simply open a new window to work on the new task and get back to the original window after your finish the new task and close that window accordingly.
* If you believe you cannot go back to your previous activity within a reasonable time period (a day for example). Close the current window and open a new window to start the new task. To make sure you have a smooth context switch, you can bundle all tabs into a folder of bookmarks and reopen those later.

# Using Chrome as a Developer
While Chrome can be used for various developing purposes, like simulating mobile devises, remotely
debugging android devices, inspecting and managing storage, databases and caches. I will mainly
focus on the more basic side of using chrome for front-end debugging.
More details about the usage of Chrome DevTools can be found in its [documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/). There is also a separate set of keyboard shortcuts for developing tools specifically, I will not do an exhaustive list of those here, interested readers can refer to the [Keyboard Shortcuts Reference](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts).

## Debugging Javascript
### Setting up breakpoints
1. **Line-of-code breakpoints**
  * Click the `Sources` tab and click on the line number column to break at a specific line.
  * Add `debugger;` in your code.
2. **Conditional line-of-code breakpoints**
  * Click the `Sources tab`, go to the line of code you want to break on. Right click it and select **Add conditional breakpoint((. ))
3. **DOM change breakpoints**:
  * Click the `Elements` tab, right click an element, hover over Break on. There are three different conditions: 1) Subtree modifications 2) Attribute modifications and 3) Node removal.
4. **XHR breakpoints**
  * Click the `Sources` tab, expand the XHR breakpoints pane and click add breakpoint.
  * Use it when you want to break when the request URL of an XHR contains a specified string.
5. **Event listener breakpoints**
  * Click the `Sources` tab, expand the Event Listener Breakpoints pane.
6. **Exception breakpoints**
  * Click on the `Sources` tab and click Pause on exceptions
7. **Function breakpoints**
  * write `debug(functionName)` in code when you want to pause whenever a specific function is called.

### Other debugging tools
Chome Devtool has the normal function of any debugging tool on controlling the execution of your code through `Step over`, `Step into`, `Step out` and `Continue to here`.  It also provides some functionalities that are especially helpful for web debugging.

1. Ignore a script or pattern of scripts.
2. Run snippets of debug code from any page.
3. Watch the values of custom JavaScript expressions
4. Make a minified file readable.

## View and Change CSS
Chrome is also extremely helpful in debugging and modifying CSS. Nothing is better for people to learn about a new tool than letting them trying themselves. Therefore, I found the [tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css/) by Google extremely helpful by providing an interactive way on the webpage to use the debugging tool. Here I am just summarizing some key points for a quick tour.
1. View CSS
  * if the stylesheet is minified, you can make the minified file readable first.
  * Inherited properties are opaque.
  * Toggle a pseudo-class
2. Change CSS
  * Add a CSS declaration
  * Add a class to an element
  * Use Color picker to change colors or change selected color to some other color on the page.


There is definitely a lot more to explore the DevTools. For example, you might want to try analyzing the runtime performance, measuring  network performance, fix memory problems, etc. sI have not personally used a lot of these features in my projects, but Chrome can be a very handy tool for all these needs in web projects. Furthermore, there are also a lot of extensions as well if you want to integrate other frameworks. One great example is debugging React and React Native.

Hope you enjoy this post and the next topic in this series will be about a powerful text editor that I use every day -- `Atom`.
