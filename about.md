<p class="message">
  Hey, I'm Haining Wang, welcome to my blog.
  <br>Hope you can find something fun here!
</p>

I identify myself as a software engineer, a researcher, a enthusiastic learner,  a mom and a hobbyist artist.

I got my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering specialized in wireless communications in 2016
 and published over 10 articles in resource management and optimization in wireless
 communications networks. I later became a research scientist who spend most of the day every day writing code and thinking about algorithms.
I am a true believer that becoming a good programmer can change your way of approaching problems and how you
live your lives (hopefully in a positive way :).

The current blog is produced through [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
<q>
Jekyll takes your content written in Markdown, passes it through your templates and spits it out as a complete static website, ready to be served.

I also likes this sidebar theme for blog a lot because it is less distracting to the content while providing nice navigation as well. After some
searching online, I found a great theme called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com), which saves me a ton of effort of writing css and layouts from scratch.
